This project is to help me become more familiar with C# while focusing on projects cybersecurity related. My goal is to replicate responder WPAD posioning that can be deployed on windows devices during an engagement.

//What currently works
* Responds to mDNS WPAD traffic
* Responds to LLMNR WPAD traffic
* Assembly can be loaded into Sliver
* net48 framework compatible
  
//To Do
* Add firewall rules capability to prevent UAC pop up
* Figure out how to redirect STDOUT to sliver cli.
